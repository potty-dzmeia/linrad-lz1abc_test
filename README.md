# Linrad - fork
This fork of linrad is used to implement and test Rig control such that Linrad and a Transceiver would work in sync.
That is, when Linrad frequency changes the Transceiver frequency will change to the same value and vice versa.

For this purpose Hamlib software is used and in particular rigctld.exe
